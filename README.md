# Gradle Galaxy

A Gradle plugin to simplify the process of creating projects. Thank you [dkim19375](https://github.com/dkim19375) for the help with some stuff :)

## Installation

You can install the plugin just like any other Gradle plugin by adding it to your plugins block. Make sure to replace `VERSION` with your [desired version](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/xyz.srnyx.gradle-galaxy). *Currently only supports Kotlin DSL!*

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("xyz.srnyx.gradle-galaxy") version "VERSION"
}
```
